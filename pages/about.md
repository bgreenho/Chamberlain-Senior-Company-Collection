## About the Chamberlain Senior Company Collection

The Chamberlain Senior Company collection is a repository of photos and videos showing ballets I performed as a member of the Chamberlain Performing Arts Senior Company during the 2013-2017 seasons. These photos and videos show on- and off-stage moments from ballets performed during the three major productions of each season: The Nutcracker, the spring show, and the end-of-season recital. 

This collection is meant to both visually represent my ballet career from 2013-2017 but also preserve and spark the memories of being a Chamberlain Performing Arts Senior Company member for that four-year period.
